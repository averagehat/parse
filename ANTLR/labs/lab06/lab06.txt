Lab 6: Creating recursive rules

A document contains a section. A section contains a title or 
a title followed by a section. Create a grammar for the document.
A title is enclosed in quotes. Here is the input:

"Section #1" "Section #2"
"Section #3"

Use this rule to tokenize each title:

STRING : '"' .+? '"' ;

That rule uses the non-greedy operator: +?, which we will discuss later.

Discard whitespace between the titles.

After you have your grammar working, modify it to implement this:

A document contains a section. A section contains a title or
a section followed by a title. (Notice that I've swapped the order
of section and title). Run your modified grammar. What did you learn?

Name the start rule: document
