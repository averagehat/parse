Lab 2: Use the -tokens, -tree, and -trace options

Rerun the grammar that you created in the last lab.

This time, however, don't use the -gui option. Instead,
use the -tokens option. Then use the -tree option. Finally,
use the -trace option. Be sure that you understand the output
that is generated for each option.
