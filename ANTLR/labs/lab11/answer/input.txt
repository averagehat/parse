Gettysburg Address
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, 
a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that 
all men are created equal.

I Have a Dream
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true 
meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all 
men are created equal."
